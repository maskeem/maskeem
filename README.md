## About me üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
I'm a full-stack web dev with a taste for front-end challenges, working mostly in **JavaScript**. I graduated from [O'clock](https://www.oclock.io) tech school as a Web and Mobile-Web Developer and I am currently looking to perfect my skills by pursuing an apprenticeship as an **App Designer & Developer**.
